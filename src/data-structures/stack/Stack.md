# Stack

## **What is a Stack?**

A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle. This means the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. You can think of a stack like a stack of plates where you add plates to the top, and when you need one, you take the top plate off.

### **Basic Operations of a Stack**

1. **push(element)**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
2. **pop()**: Removes the top element of the stack and returns it.
3. **peek()**: Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.
4. **isEmpty()**: Returns `true` if the stack is empty, otherwise `false`.
5. **size()**: Returns the number of elements in the stack.
6. **clear()**: Clears all elements in the stack

### **Stack Operations Complexity**

- **push()**: O(1) – Adding an element takes constant time.
- **pop()**: O(1) – Removing an element takes constant time.
- **peek()**: O(1) – Viewing the top element takes constant time.
- **isEmpty()**: O(1) – Checking if the stack is empty is constant time.
- **size()**: O(1) – Checking the size of the stack is constant time.
