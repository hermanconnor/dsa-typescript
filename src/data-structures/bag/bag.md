# # What is a Bag?

A **Bag** (also called a **Multiset**) is a collection data structure that allows duplicate elements but doesn't maintain any particular order. Think of it like a shopping bag - you can put multiple items of the same type in it, and you don't care about the order they're arranged.

## Key Characteristics

- **Allows duplicates**: Unlike a Set, you can add the same element multiple times
- **Unordered**: Elements have no specific sequence
- **Core operations**: add, remove, contains, size, isEmpty
