## 🛠️ Setup

To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository:**

2. **Install dependencies:**

   This project uses **Vite** and **Vitest**. Install the dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## 🧪 Running Tests

This project uses **Vitest** for running unit tests. Here's how you can run the tests:

1. **Run all tests:**

   To run all tests in the repository, simply run:

   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Master fundamental data structures and their operations
- Understand time and space complexity analysis
- Practice implementing algorithms from scratch
- Build problem-solving skills
- Write clean, type-safe TypeScript code

## 📝 Notes

This repository is a work in progress as I continue learning and implementing new data structures and algorithms.
