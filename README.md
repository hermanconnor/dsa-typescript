- **Singly Linked List**
- **Doubly Linked List**
- **Queue**
- **Deque**
- **Graph**
- **Binary Search Tree**
- **Heaps**
- **Hash Table**
- **Trie**
- **Union-Find (Disjoint Set)**

## Algorithms

## Usage

To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository:**

2. **Install dependencies:**

   This project uses **Vite** and **Vitest**. Install the dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running Tests

This project uses **Vitest** for running unit tests. Here's how you can run the tests:

1. **Run all tests:**

   To run all tests in the repository, simply run:

   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```
